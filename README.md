# Meme_gen

Meme_gen is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that allows users to create, edit, and bookmark memes in their accounts for easy access. Users can choose from predefined meme templates or upload custom images to edit with text. The app leverages ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication, Fabric.js for in-browser image editing, and a responsive design inspired by Pinterest.
